## Description 
This project will create a database which will collect from a third-party API and track an individual's contribution with respect to time. The database will calculate the growth of shares and dividends earned. A table will be created to collect all user info and link and have a one-to-many relationship to a table of all vested stocks. Another table will break down the share in further details for smart investments.

## Installation 
Once pulled from the repository install all required packages by using the "npm -i" and install nodemon as a dev dependency by typing "node i -D nodemon". Also, make sure that the .env file is set up correctly. The following will need to be set
    1. MYSQL_HOST = '127.0.0.1'
    2. DB_USER = 'root'
    3. DB_PASSWORD = This is the password for your mysql login
    4. DB_NAME = 'user_info'

Once everything is setup, type npm run dev in order to initialize the script.
